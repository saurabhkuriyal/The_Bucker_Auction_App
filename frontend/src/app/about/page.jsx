        </h1>

        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Welcome to <span className="font-semibold">The Bucker Auction</span>, a trusted 
          online platform designed to connect sellers and buyers of bulls through 
          live auctions. We aim to provide a transparent, fair, and efficient 
          marketplace where sellers can showcase their bulls and buyers can 
          participate in competitive bidding.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          As a platform, we do not take part in the transactions between sellers 
          and buyers. Our role is to provide a secure and user-friendly 
          environment where auctions can take place seamlessly. Sellers can list 
          their bulls for auction, while buyers can browse and bid with ease.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Our revenue model is simple: we charge sellers a listing fee to put 
          their bulls on auction. This helps us maintain the platform, improve 
          features, and ensure smooth operations for both sellers and buyers.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Whether youâ€™re a farmer, breeder, or buyer looking for the right bull, 
          BullAuction is here to simplify the process and connect you with the 
          right opportunities.
